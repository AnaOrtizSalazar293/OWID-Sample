# OWID-Sample
This sample code gets bilateral trade data of plastic waste from the UN Comtrade database using HTTP requests. It also generates simple network and exploratory visualizations by region and country-level transactions. The original project analyzes changes in plastic trade before and after 2018 (when China's National Sword Policy was implemented, which banned plastic waste imports).
